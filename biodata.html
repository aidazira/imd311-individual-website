                            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                            <P>Hello, welcome to my profile! I'm Aida Azirah, a passionate and enthusiastic individual who is currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Management. 
                                I genuinely believe that knowledge is an individual's greatest asset, and I'm intrigued to explore everything it has to offer in the fast-paced world 
                                we live in presently. My full name is Nurul Aida Azirah Binti Sobri. I am 21 years old. I live in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. 
                                For my education, I'm currently studying at Universiti Teknologi MARA 
                                <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">(UiTM)</abbr>, 
                                Rembau Campus which is located at Negeri Sembilan. My course falls under Information Science Studies, College of Computing, Informatics, and Mathematics. 
                                I embarked on my diploma journey in 2021 and will finish my studies soon in 2023. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you can find me indulging in my greatest passions, 
                                music, and entertainment. I am into Korean Pop Music with various kinds of genres such as R&B, EDM, Hip Hop, alternative rock and so much more. Music plays a huge part in my life, 
                                and it can significantly boost my mood. My favorite artists are ATEEZ and XIKERS. I've been a really big fan of them ever since they were in their rookie era. 
                                My favorite song at the moment is This world by ATEEZ. Their infectious melodies and captivating performances have been a constant source of inspiration for me.
                                Music, for me, is not only a form of entertainment but a way to connect with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. ATEEZ and XIKERS hold a special place in my heart 
                                because their music reflects themes of determination, resilience, and the pursuit of dreams, qualities I strive to incorporate into my academic and personal life. 
                                Moreover, their ability to create a strong sense of community among their fans resonates deeply with me. My hope for the future is that I want to graduate with Vice-Chancellor Award (ANC).</P>
